genetics
========

I want to write here a Library to calculate the results of a mating. 
Why? Well, because I want to practice TDD and I'm interested in genetics. That way I can combine two 
things I like. 

I also want to record the progress in my [blog](http://olorin71.github.io)

My goal is a clean and clear implementation to achieve. 
And then to be able to use this Library in other Projects.
